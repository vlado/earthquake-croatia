## Things to keep in mind

We need the UI to be responsive since this app is heavily used on mobile phones.

## Environment setup

### Make it simple

```bash
# Build the container
make build

# Create, migrate and seed the database
make db-create

# Start the server
make server
```

### Docker Compose

```bash
# Generate Docker bundle
docker-compose build

# Start Docker containers
docker-compose up

# In another console run
docker-compose run web rails db:create
docker-compose run web rails db:migrate
docker-compose run web rails webpacker:install

```

### Local installation

#### Ruby setup

```bash
# Install gnupg
brew install gnupg

# Add rvm gpg key
gpg --keyserver hkp://pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB

# Pull latest rvm
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby

# Install ruby 2.7.1
rvm install ruby-2.7.1

# Activate environment
source ${HOME}/.rvm/scripts/rvm
```

#### System dependencies

```bash
# On OSX install postgres and run server
brew install postgresql
brew services start postgresql

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Initialize and migrate database
rails db:create
rails db:migrate

# Install webpack
rails webpacker:install
```

#### [optional] Add dummy data

```bash
rails db:seed
```

#### Run server

```bash
bin/rails server
bin/webpack-dev-server
```

or if you use foreman

```bash
foreman start -f Procfile.dev
```

#### Tests

First set up the test database with:
```bash
RAILS_ENV=test bin/rails db:setup
```
Note that this will also seed it with data from `db/seed.rb`.

And then run with
```bash
rspec
```

If you want to see the system tests running in visible chrome run it with:
```bash
HEADLESS=false rspec
```
